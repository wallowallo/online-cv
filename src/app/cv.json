  "aboutMe":"I recently embarked on this adventure called Web Development, and fell in love with the idea that I'm able to create and bring ideas to life through the wonders of HTML, CSS and JS. I believe that through visions, incremental progress, encouraging words and teamwork, we can accomplish great things. I focus on new technologies so that we can give the user the best experience possible. I'm eager to learn more about the processes of the SDLC, teamwork and leadership. I'm also more than happy to share my knowledge about what I know so far. My goal is to improve in various aspects in life in general to become the best version of me possible."
